A few weeks ago, I decided to become a hardware girl. I'm going to build things with my own two hands, and program them with — (looks at keyboard) — my own two hands, and set them free in the world.

(On a related note, I'm going to Burning Man this year, and have gotten involved with an art project that requires some programming and some building. One thing I know about myself is that I don't necessarily always follow through on things, so I'm trying to make my new-maker-persona accountable to as many other people as possible.)

Now, when I set out to do this, I assumed it would be easy. (This is what I assume when I start all things, and I am wrong most of the time.) I thought about the time I helped my dad replace the graphics card in his old PC, circa 1998, and oh shit I just realized I was six years old when that happened and I probably wasn't the big help I thought I was.

Still though. You just plug stuff into other stuff, right? I mean, what's a breadboard for, if it's not just a huge USB port for everything you want to connect to your program, effortlessly?
