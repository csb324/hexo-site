Once I'd shaken off my post-speech adrenaline, I had an awesome time talking to all of the other Monktoberfest attendees and speakers. Someone should really buy the whole [Monktoberfest](https://monktoberfest.com/) team a beer, because they bought us a *bunch* of beers and overall organized a great space to talk about the internet and the world.
