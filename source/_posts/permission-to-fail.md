I've been reading a lot of articles about failure lately. I'm not totally sure why they've been cropping up on my twitter feed, but it's probably a sign from the universe. Maybe it has something to do with this whole mercury-in-retrograde situation. Who's to say?

Anyway, I came across this great video that I had seen before, assigned in an intro to fiction writing class in college.

It was a good thing to read in a fiction writing class because college-freshman fiction is *garbage*, and you need to be prepared for that. But I just re-happened-upon it from this [great set of advice from Mike Birbiglia][http://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/movies/mike-birbiglias-6-tips-for-making-it-small-in-hollywood-or-anywhere.html?partner=rss&emc=rss&utm_medium=twitter&utm_source=twitterfeed], and I noticed a few new things.

1) I am at the phase in my web-developer life where I know what good code looks like but I'm still only good at writing it some of the time.

2) Being a college student was a great emotional platform from which to be creative. I had such low expectations for myself (because LOL I'M IN COLLEGE), and it gave me quite a lot of freedom.
